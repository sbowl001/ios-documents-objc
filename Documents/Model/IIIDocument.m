@implementation IIIDocument

//Create a Cocoa Touch Subclass of NSObject called Document (with your prefix).
//Add properties with the appropriate types and property attributes for a document's title, text, and word count.
//Create an initializer that will set the model's title and text, but not the word count.
//Create a custom property accessor for the word count property. In the accessor, use the wordCount method you just created in the NSString category. (Remember to import the "NSString+WordCount.h" file or you won't be able to access the method)
